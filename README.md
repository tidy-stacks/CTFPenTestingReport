This was a report created from the CTF (Capture the Flag) exercise where the goal was to exploit a fictional corporation, based off of the 1990's action movie classic Total Rekall, web application, linux servers, and windows servers. The report has the following structure a general overview of potential vulnerabilities and how to improve Total Rekall's risk exposure,along with how each potential vulnerability relates to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. There were roughly 30 flags and I found them all and wrote up each vulnerability and a mitigation strategy for each potential incident.
